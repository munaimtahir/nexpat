## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:
1. Choose the appropriate subdirectory based on purpose
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames
3. Add links to this README if it's a major document
4. Update the root README if it affects getting started
5. Keep documentation close to code when it's code-specific (e.g., app READMEs)
