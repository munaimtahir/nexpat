# Merge Conflict Resolution Instructions

## Overview
The conflicts detected by GitHub's automerger are **file location conflicts** resulting from the directory restructuring. The actual file content is already correct in the branch - these conflicts just need confirmation.

## Conflicts Detected

### 1. `apps/mobile/docs/STATUS.md`
- **Type**: Both Added
- **Resolution**: ✅ Keep the version in `apps/mobile/docs/STATUS.md`
- **Reason**: This file already contains the correct content from main branch (added in commit c86b0a7)

### 2. `clinicq_Mobile/docs/TASKS.md`
- **Type**: Deleted by us, modified by them
- **Resolution**: ✅ Remove the old path `clinicq_Mobile/docs/TASKS.md`
- **Reason**: The file now exists at `apps/mobile/docs/TASKS.md` with the updated content from main

## Why These Conflicts Occur

The restructuring renamed:
- `clinicq_Mobile/` → `apps/mobile/`
- `clinicq_backend/` → `apps/backend/`
- `clinicq_frontend/` → `apps/web/`

While the restructuring was in progress, the main branch added/modified files in the old paths. Git's merge algorithm detects this as a conflict because:
1. We "deleted" files at old paths (by renaming the directory)
2. Main "added/modified" files at those same old paths
3. We copied the new files to the restructured paths

## Resolution Steps on GitHub

When GitHub prompts you to resolve conflicts:

1. **For `apps/mobile/docs/STATUS.md`**:
   - Click "Use this version" or accept the file from the restructured branch
   - This file already has the correct content

2. **For `clinicq_Mobile/docs/TASKS.md`**:
   - Confirm deletion of the old path
   - The file exists at the new path `apps/mobile/docs/TASKS.md`

3. **Complete the merge**
   - Mark conflicts as resolved
   - Complete the merge commit

## Verification

After merging, verify that:
- ✅ `apps/mobile/docs/STATUS.md` exists with complete content (437 lines)
- ✅ `apps/mobile/docs/TASKS.md` exists with task checklist
- ✅ No files remain in old `clinicq_*` directories
- ✅ All paths in documentation point to new structure

## Alternative: Manual Merge Command

If you prefer to merge locally:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge copilot/fix-645ba070-a6a3-4877-81e8-d093c7589d15

# When conflicts appear:
git add apps/mobile/docs/STATUS.md
git rm clinicq_Mobile/docs/TASKS.md
git commit -m "Merge branch with restructured repository layout"
git push origin main
```

## Summary

**The branch is ready to merge.** These are expected file location conflicts from the directory restructuring. The files already exist in the correct locations with the correct content. The automerger just needs confirmation to:
1. Accept files in new locations (`apps/*`)
2. Remove old directory paths (`clinicq_*`)

No code changes are needed - this is purely a directory structure confirmation.
