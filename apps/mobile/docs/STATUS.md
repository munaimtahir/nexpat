# Development Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-03  
**Current Phase:** Phase 3 (Uploads & Offline) - Near Complete

## Executive Summary

The ClinicQ Mobile app is a React Native (Expo) application that provides a mobile interface for clinic management. The application is currently in **Phase 3** of development with most core features completed and working. The app is functional but not yet production-ready.

### Current Stage: **MVP Complete + Advanced Features**

The application has completed all Phase 1 & 2 foundational work and core workflows, and has substantially completed Phase 3 (uploads and offline capabilities). Phase 4 (quality & release preparation) remains to be implemented.

## Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
cd clinicq_Mobile
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with SERVER_URL
npx expo start
```

### Available Commands
- `npm start` - Start Expo dev server
- `npm run android` - Run on Android device/emulator
- `npm run ios` - Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
- `npm test` - Run Jest tests (no tests implemented yet)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript compiler check

### API Client Regeneration
When backend API changes:
```bash
# From backend, expose OpenAPI schema at /api/schema/
npx openapi-typescript-codegen --input http://localhost:8000/api/schema/ --output src/api/generated
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **No Tests:** Testing infrastructure is configured but no tests have been written
2. **No CI/CD:** No automated builds or deployments
3. **Urdu Missing:** Only English translations exist
4. **No Dark Theme:** Light theme only
5. **Image Compression:** Uploads send full-size images (bandwidth intensive)
6. **Limited Error Recovery:** Some edge cases in offline mode may not be handled
7. **No Push Notifications:** Real-time updates require manual refresh
8. **Single Clinic:** No multi-clinic/multi-tenant support

## Metrics & Progress

### Code Statistics
- **Screens:** 10 screens implemented
- **API Hooks:** 4 hook files (patients, visits, uploads, diagnostics)
- **Lines of Code:** ~3,500+ TypeScript/TSX
- **Components:** 5 reusable components
- **Test Coverage:** 0% (no tests written)

### Phase Completion
- **Phase 1 (Foundations):** ✅ 100% Complete
- **Phase 2 (Core Workflows):** ✅ 100% Complete  
- **Phase 3 (Uploads & Offline):** ⚠️ ~85% Complete

## Conclusion

The ClinicQ Mobile app has successfully implemented all core functionality required for an MVP and is feature-complete for basic clinic operations. The app includes sophisticated offline support, role-based workflows, and a polished user interface. 

The main gap is in **quality assurance and production readiness**: testing, internationalization completion, CI/CD, and performance optimization. With focused effort on Phase 4 items, the app could be production-ready within 1-2 months.

The foundation is solid and the architecture supports the planned future enhancements without major refactoring.
