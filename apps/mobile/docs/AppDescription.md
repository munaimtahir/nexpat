# App Description (Non-Technical)
ClinicQ Mobile is a simple Android app for clinics. Staff can log in, register patients, place them in a queue, and doctors can see who’s next. It also supports a big “Public Display” screen to show the waiting list. The app is fast, works during short internet problems, surfaces clear “offline” badges when data is cached, and now lets teams batch-capture prescriptions with an in-app viewer. The first launch targets English, with additional languages planned later.
