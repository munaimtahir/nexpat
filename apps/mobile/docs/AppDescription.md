# App Description (Non-Technical)
ClinicQ Mobile is a simple Android app for clinics. Staff can log in, register patients, place them in a queue, and doctors can see who’s next. It also supports a big “Public Display” screen to show the waiting list. The app is fast, works during short internet problems, and launches in English (additional languages are planned later).
